Design and UVM-based Verification of UART | Self Project (Jan’25)
− Implemented UART Transmitter and Receiver in verilog HDL with flexible Baud Rate Generator
− Built the design verification environment using Sequencer, Driver, Monitor and Scoreboard modules
− Verified the UART data transmission and reception protocols using UVM Testbench Architecture
